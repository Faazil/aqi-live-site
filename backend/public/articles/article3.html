      <h2>Why Indian cities are polluted</h2>
      <p>Indian urban air pollution is driven by a mix of sources: traffic and transport emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, residential cooking and heating, open burning of crop residue, and seasonal factors like winter inversion that trap pollutants close to the ground.</p><p>Transport</p><p>Vehicle emissions are a major source of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, especially in rapidly motorising cities. Poorly maintained vehicles and high diesel use contribute disproportionately to urban pollution.</p><p>Industry and power generation</p><p>Industrial stacks and coal-fired power plants emit sulphur dioxide, particulates and other pollutants. Where industrial zones are close to urban areas, the local population bears the brunt of exposure.</p><p>Agricultural burning and seasonal spikes</p><p>Cropland burning in neighbouring states causes seasonal spikes of PM2.5 in major cities. Coupled with cooler temperatures and atmospheric inversions in winter, this leads to sustained high AQI levels for weeks.</p><p>Policy responses</p><p>Solutions include cleaner fuels and vehicles, industrial emission controls, stricter construction dust management, better urban planning and regional coordination on agricultural burning. Real-world progress requires investment and enforcement.</p>
