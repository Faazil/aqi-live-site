<h2>Delhi AQI trends: causes, seasons and what residents can do</h2>
<p>Delhi experiences some of the highest air pollution episodes in the world. Multiple factors — emissions from traffic, industry, and seasonal agricultural burning — combine with meteorological conditions to create prolonged periods of poor air quality in winter.</p>


<h3>Seasonal pattern</h3>
<p>Air quality in Delhi tends to worsen in late autumn and winter. Cooler temperatures and calm winds lead to atmospheric inversions that trap pollutants. At the same time, crop residue burning in neighbouring states adds to the pollutant load.</p>


<h3>Local actions residents can take</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use an indoor air purifier with HEPA filter if possible.</li>
<li>Limit outdoor exercise on high AQI days.</li>
<li>Seal windows and doors during pollution spikes.</li>
<li>Advocate for cleaner public transport and reduced open burning.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Policy and long-term fixes</h3>
<p>Long-term improvement requires regional cooperation on agricultural burning, cleaner fuels and vehicles, improved industrial emission controls and urban planning that reduces congestion and dust.</p>
