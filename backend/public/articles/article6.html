      <h2>Practical tips to reduce pollution exposure</h2>
      <p>Reducing exposure to air pollution is about a mixture of short-term actions on high AQI days and long-term habits that lower risk. Here are practical steps families and individuals can use immediately.</p><p>Short-term actions (high AQI days)</p><p>1. Stay indoors when AQI is in the 'Poor' range or worse. 2. Avoid outdoor exercise and heavy exertion. 3. Use an air purifier with HEPA filter in living and sleeping areas. 4. Keep windows closed and run exhaust fans conservatively to avoid drawing polluted air in.</p><p>Daily habits</p><p>Reduce use of polluting fuels at home, avoid burning waste, and choose public transport or carpooling where possible. When commuting, avoid idling in heavy traffic and consider routes with less congestion or more vegetation.</p><p>Community and advocacy</p><p>Work with neighbours and local groups to push for cleaner buses, safe disposal of construction dust, proper management of street vendors' emissions and stronger enforcement of emission standards.</p><p>Protective equipment</p><p>On very poor air days, an N95 (or equivalent) respirator offers better protection than a cloth mask. Make sure respirators fit well and are used according to guidance.</p>
