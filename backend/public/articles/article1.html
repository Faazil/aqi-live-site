      <h2>What is AQI and how is it calculated?</h2>
      <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a single number used to communicate how polluted the air currently is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for the public. Instead of presenting raw pollutant concentrations for a handful of chemicals, AQI converts those numbers into a scale that is easier to understand.</p><p>Which pollutants are included?</p><p>Most AQI systems evaluate several common air pollutants. In India these typically include:</p><p>• PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) • PM10 (coarse particulate matter) • NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) • SO2 (sulphur dioxide) • O3 (ozone) • CO (carbon monoxide)</p><p>How is the AQI number produced?</p><p>Each pollutant's measured concentration is converted into a normalized sub-index using a breakpoint table (a set of ranges). The highest sub-index among the measured pollutants becomes the reported AQI. This approach ensures the AQI reflects the pollutant that poses the greatest health risk at the time.</p><p>What do the AQI categories mean?</p><p>Although the exact labels may vary by country, AQI categories generally indicate health risk growing from 'Good' to 'Hazardous'. For example:</p><p>0–50: Good 51–100: Satisfactory/Moderate 101–200: Poor 201–300: Very Poor 301–400: Severe 401–500: Hazardous</p><p>Limitations and context</p><p>AQI simplifies complex science into a single number; it is useful for public guidance, but not a substitute for detailed scientific analysis. AQI can vary rapidly over short distances and times; local sources and microclimates affect readings. Always consult local monitoring agencies for official advisories.</p><p>Practical takeaway</p><p>Use AQI to plan outdoor activities — when AQI is high, reduce strenuous outdoor activity, keep children and older adults indoors when possible, and follow local public health advice.</p>
