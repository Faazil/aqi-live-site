<h2>What is AQI and how is it calculated?</h2>
<p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a single number used to communicate how polluted the air currently is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for the public. Instead of presenting raw pollutant concentrations for a handful of chemicals, AQI converts those numbers into a scale that is easier to understand.</p>


<h3>Which pollutants are included?</h3>
<p>Most AQI systems evaluate several common air pollutants. In India these typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>PM2.5 (fine particulate matter)</li>
<li>PM10 (coarse particulate matter)</li>
<li>NO2 (nitrogen dioxide)</li>
<li>SO2 (sulphur dioxide)</li>
<li>O3 (ozone)</li>
<li>CO (carbon monoxide)</li>
</ul>


<h3>How is the AQI number produced?</h3>
<p>Each pollutant's measured concentration is converted into a normalized sub-index using a breakpoint table (a set of ranges). The highest sub-index among the measured pollutants becomes the reported AQI. This approach ensures the AQI reflects the pollutant that poses the greatest health risk at the time.</p>


<h3>What do the AQI categories mean?</h3>
<p>Although the exact labels may vary by country, AQI categories generally indicate health risk growing from 'Good' to 'Hazardous'. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>0–50: Good</li>
<li>51–100: Satisfactory/Moderate</li>
<li>101–200: Poor</li>
<li>201–300: Very Poor</li>
<li>301–400: Severe</li>
<li>401–500: Hazardous</li>
</ul>


<h3>Limitations and context</h3>
<p>AQI simplifies complex science into a single number; it is useful for public guidance, but not a substitute for detailed scientific analysis. AQI can vary rapidly over short distances and times; local sources and microclimates affect readings. Always consult local monitoring agencies for official advisories.</p>


<h3>Practical takeaway</h3>
<p>Use AQI to plan outdoor activities — when AQI is high, reduce strenuous outdoor activity, keep children and older adults indoors when possible, and follow local public health advice.</p>
