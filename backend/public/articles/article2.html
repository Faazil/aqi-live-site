<h2>How air pollution affects health in India</h2>
<p>Air pollution is a leading environmental risk factor for disease globally, and India bears a disproportionate share of this burden. Short-term exposure can trigger asthma attacks, respiratory infections and acute cardiovascular events. Long-term exposure is linked to chronic respiratory diseases, heart disease, stroke and reduced life expectancy.</p>


<h3>Vulnerable groups</h3>
<p>Children, older adults, pregnant people and individuals with pre-existing heart or lung conditions are particularly vulnerable. Children are more exposed relative to body weight and their developing lungs make them more susceptible to long-term damage.</p>


<h3>Short-term effects</h3>
<p>High AQI days commonly lead to more hospital visits for breathing difficulties, wheeze, chest pain and wheezing. Even healthy adults may experience eye irritation, coughing and reduced exercise tolerance when pollutants spike.</p>


<h3>Long-term effects</h3>
<p>Chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with increased incidence of chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. Studies estimate that air pollution contributes to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths in India each year.</p>


<h3>Mitigation and personal protection</h3>
<p>On poor air quality days: limit outdoor exercise, keep windows closed, use HEPA-capable air purifiers if available, and avoid smoking indoors. For long-term protection, policy actions matter: emission controls, cleaner fuels, industry controls and robust public transport reduce population-level risk.</p>


<h3>Community action</h3>
<p>Communities can advocate for green spaces, monitor local sources of pollution, and press for local policies that reduce burning of waste, improve vehicle emissions and reduce industrial emissions near residential areas.</p>
